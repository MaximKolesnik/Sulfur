Sulfur Engine is a tech heavy project with a large focus on graphics and physics.  A WYSIWYG editor was developed in addition to the engine to allow for faster iterations while creating content and, more importantly, to easily test graphics and physics implementations during development.
The purpose of this project is providing an easy to use game engine for designers and a good API for developers to expand on.  With our tools, this project should allow developers benchmark different techniques on various types of games and game worlds.
